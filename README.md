****CV UJM Employee Evaluation System**
**A Final Project (Skripsi) for S1 Teknik Informatika, Universitas Dinamika Bangsa****


**üìñ Overview**

This project implements a TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)-based employee evaluation system for CV Utomo Jaya Mandiri (UJM). It simplifies and enhances employee evaluation processes by providing a systematic and efficient decision-making framework.

Key Features
Employee evaluation using the TOPSIS method for objective decision-making.
Built with native PHP for backend logic.
MySQL for relational database management.
Customizable criteria and weights for evaluation parameters.




**üöÄ Getting Started**

Prerequisites
PHP: Version 7.4 or higher.
MySQL: Version 5.7 or higher.
Web Server: Apache or Nginx (with PHP support) / XAMPP.



**üìä Usage**

Key Functionalities
1. Employee Data Management
   - Add, update, and delete employee records.
   - Maintain an accurate database of employee information.
2. Criteria Management
   - Define and customize evaluation criteria.
   - Set weights for each criterion based on organizational priorities.
3. TOPSIS Evaluation
   - Automate ranking of employees using the TOPSIS algorithm.
   - Generate evaluation results with easy-to-interpret rankings.
4. Reports
   - View and export evaluation summaries for organizational records.



**üåü TOPSIS Method**

The TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method is a multi-criteria decision-making approach that ranks options based on their proximity to an ideal solution.

Steps in TOPSIS:
1. Normalize the decision matrix.
2. Calculate weighted normalized decision matrix.
3. Identify the ideal and anti-ideal solutions.
4. Compute the distance to the ideal and anti-ideal solutions.
5. Rank options based on closeness coefficients.
6. This method ensures objective and accurate employee evaluation.
